count = 0
while count < 5:

    print(zerooo)

# Both count += 1 and count = count + 1 do the exact same thing: they increment the value of count by 1 each time the loop runs.
# The += version is just a shortcutâ€”a cleaner, more compact way to write it. But behind the scenes, Python treats them identically.
